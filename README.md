# Q and A React Tutorial

```
$ rails new qa-react-tutorial
$ cd qa-react-tutorial
$ bundle install
```

*First time I ran bundle install - I received an error installing ffi. Please  
make sure XCode and XCode command line tools are installed. In my case, I had  
to open up XCode and allow it to finish installing and then rerun bundle
install.*
